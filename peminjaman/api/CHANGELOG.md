## Migration Guide

### From Node.js Backend
If migrating from the Node.js backend:

1. Update frontend API URL:
   ```javascript
   // From:
   const API = 'http://localhost:4000/api';
   // To:
   const API = 'http://localhost/peminjaman/api';
   ```

2. Response format remains the same (JSON)
3. Token format and validation compatible
4. All endpoints maintain same structure
